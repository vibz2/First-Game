## 🎓 What I Learned

It was very daunting at first trying to learn how to make my first game. However, with YouTube tutorials and guides online, I managed to do it! 

**Time Investment**: Surprisingly, it took around **5 hours** to create this game, which probably only has 5 minutes of playtime. 

### Key Takeaways:

- ✅ **Moving Platforms**: Implemented platforms with their own animations
- ✅ **Godot Interface**: Learned the basics of the Godot Engine interface
- ✅ **Interactive Platforms**: Made platforms respond to player actions (this was *so* challenging!)
- ✅ **Level Design**: Designed game settings using tile maps
- ✅ **Game Logic**: Added functions to supplement coin collection mechanics

This entire experience really taught me a lot, which I am planning to use to make even more mini games, to eventually build the skills to make my own full-time game!
