🎓 What I Learned
[It was very daunting at first trying to learn how to make my first game. However, with youtube tutorials and guides online I
managed to do it! It took around 5 hours surprisingly enough to make this which probably only has 5 minutes of playtime. Nonetheless, through this
I have learned how to implement moving platforms with their own animations, the basics of godot interface, how to make platforms respond to player
actions (this was so challenging), how to design a game setting with tile maps, and so much more. This entire experience really taught me a lot,
which I am planning to use to make even more mini games, to eventually build the skills to make my own full time game!]

🐛 Known Issues

[Trying to make platforms one way]
[Getting animations to work based on player mechanics]
[animating the players and enemies for different movements and situations]
[adding functions to supplement coin disappearing]
